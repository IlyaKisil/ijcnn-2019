## I want to follow along in a Cloud

-   This is as simple as clicking on the `binder` badge above
-   No headache with installation and/or configuration
-   Requires internet connection
-   Fresh environment when binder session expires

Although, this option comes at the cost of lower computational resources being available to you, but it will be sufficient for the introductory purpose of this tutorial.

> **Note:** It may take a couple of minutes to launch a `binder` server. If it takes longer then that, try to refresh the web page before [reporting this issue](#reporting-problems-and-issues).


## I want to follow along on my PC

###  Getting source files

Preferred option is to clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlyaKisil/ijcnn-2019.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP folder with all materials for this assignment by using the `Clone or Download` button (in green color) at the top of this page.

###  Preparing working environment
> **Note:** Regardless, of your operating system, make sure that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

```bash        
cd ijcnn-2019

# Create venv with conda
conda create -y --name "ijcnn-2019" python=3.6.5 pip
conda activate "ijcnn-2019"

# Install dependencies for this tutorial
pip  install -r requirements.txt    

# Install kernel if you prefer to
python -m ipykernel install --user --name "ijcnn-2019" --display-name "ijcnn-2019"

# Install jupyterlab extensions (for interactive visualisations)
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager --no-build
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/toc --no-build
jupyter lab clean
jupyter lab build
```

Then download [this dataset](http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~csp-mandic/html/projects/inns_2019/data/ETH80.zip) and extract it into the `data` directory.


If you are on **Unix**, then simply execute in terminal:

```bash
cd ijcnn-2019
./boostrap-venv.sh
```

If during setup process you get error message
```
RemoveError: 'requests' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from canada's operating environment.
```
then you need to update your `conda` package and and cleanup location where conda installes virtual environments
```bash
conda update conda
rm -rf ${ANACONDA_HOME}/envs/ijcnn-2019
```
Typically, `${ANACONDA_HOME}` resides in the root of your home directory


### Start Jupyter Lab
```bash
cd ijcnn-2019
conda activate ijcnn-2019
jupyter lab
```

### Removing venv and ipython kernel
```bash
conda deactivate
jupyter kernelspec uninstall ijcnn-2019
conda env remove -n ijcnn-2019
```

## Reporting problems and issues

Please use one of [these forms](https://github.com/IlyaKisil/ijcnn-2019/issues/new/choose) which supports `markdown` text formatting. It would also be helpful if you include as much relevant information as possible. This could include screenshots, code snippets etc.
